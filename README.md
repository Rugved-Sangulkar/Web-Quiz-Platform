📝 Quiz Platform Web App

This is a front-end-only web application that allows users to create quizzes and attempt quizzes within the same interface. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any backend. All quiz data is handled on the client side, enabling users to build their own quiz and take it immediately.

📌 Project Overview

Users can dynamically create a quiz by entering questions and options.

All quizzes are stored temporarily using JavaScript variables / localStorage (no database).

Users can then attempt the quiz, answer questions, and receive a score at the end.

The aim of this project is to simulate an interactive quiz platform front-end, which can later be connected to a backend for persistent data.
